## Summary

This is my final project that I made in order to pass SoftUni's React course. It's a SPA Library app with adding and editing books in a catalog, my book favourites list and Firebase authentication. If you are a logged in user, you can add books, edit and delete your books from their Details page. Also you can add books that are not created from you to your book list.

## Setup

Install the dependencies in the client folder with Node.js v18.14.0

```bash
$ npm install
```

Start the client dev server

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

The client application will be available at `http://localhost:5173/`

Start the back-end from the server folder

```bash
$ npm start
```
