## Summary

This is my final project that I made in order to pass SoftUni's React course.

## Setup

Install the dependencies in the client folder with Node.js v18.14.0

```bash
$ npm install
```

Start the client dev server

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

The client application will be available at `http://localhost:5173/`

Start the back-end from the server folder

```bash
$ npm start
```
